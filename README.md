# Lets-Blog

Feel like journaling and expressing your daily feelings, events, experiences, and accomplishments!
I have created a Full-Stack Blog Web App that allows you to add, track, access, and store your submitted blog posts using MongoDB on your local device.

The application uses: 
- Embded Javascript libraries (EJS)
- Express modules such as EJS Layouts -- headers/footers
- Bootstrap design styles

The functionaity is enchanced through self createed and inner modular export of Express modules that are connected with MongoDB routing parameter functions
